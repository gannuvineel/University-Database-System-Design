The University of Canada is an institution that provides different courses to various students. There are huge data associated with the university such as the student details, course details, faculty details, department details, and much more. File systems can be used to store university data. The issue with storing the data using file systems is that the data is inconsistent and there is a possibility of having redundant data. To overcome the problems of file systems, a Database Management System (DBMS) for the university data is designed and developed. Storing the data in a DBMS helps the users to efficiently access the data, enforce the constraints while updating the data and the users can concurrently access the data. A web application is created through which the data is accessed from the databases by different users.
